# Character and Digit Recognition - CNN 

Handwritten character and Digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning.
This Project explores the use of Convolution Neural Network (CNNs) to recognize and classify handwritten character and digits.
The dataset used for training and testing the MNIST dataset, Which contians a large collection of handwritten digits. The project employ Python and popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the CNN model.
The trained model demonstrates impressive accuracy in classifying handwritten characters and digits.
